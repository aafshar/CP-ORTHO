# CP-ORTHO
For running the CP-ORTHO, you need to run the main.m.

The implementation of CP-ORTHO has been tested on Matlab 2017.
We used Matlab Tensor Toolbox which included in the code.(http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.6.html)


Syntethic Data
===============
You can generate different types of syntethic data in Synthetic_data.m
For adding noise just run add_noise.m after generating the synthetic data.

This code accompanies the submission ìCP-ORTHO: An Orthogonal Tensor Factorization Framework for Spatio-Temporal Dataî by ìArdavan Afsharî.
